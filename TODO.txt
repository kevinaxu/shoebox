TODO
====
- *How do I adjust so that I don't have to do the verification step each time? 

- Handle character encoding? 
	- Assume that file contents are well formed? 

- When do I need to use the os.path.expanduser (http://effbot.org/librarybook/os-path.htm)

- Create a folder for the Google Drive shoebox app when first initialized

- Problems when uploading over file types in Google Drive (ex pdf). 
	- Probably have to change from text/plain to some other type

- shoebox> design a shoebox shell 
	- ls
	- cd
	- mkdir
	- rm 
	- mv 
	- help 
	- search? 
- Probably need to login to the shoebox shell right? 

- Installation script
	- Ask if pip is already installed
	- pip install dropbox 
	- pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client (do you need this?)
		- or is it already a dependency?
	- pip install pydrive 
	- Create a project directory in google drive
	- Use the Dropbox client id and secret to authorize the app and get the 
		access code. Store this access code somewhere? 
	- Save Google Drive credentials in config. 
	- Google Drive client_secrets.json needs to be stored somewhere
	- Make sure the settings are configured

- When uploading to Google Drive, make sure that the root directory is the shoebox app directory. 

- Obfuscate the file/folder names as well 

- Encrypt the file with access codes?

- Reauthenticating/Refreshing access token for Dropbox

- In the README, make a final directory tree so that the user knows where the files (esp config files) should be 
bin/
    dir.py
    main.py
    usr/
        user.py

- UPLOADS folder in shoebox root dir of Dropbox and Drive? 

- Clean up imports at the beginning of scripts

Meeting
- Cryptographic hash/check sum
- Which problems do we solve/which don’t we solve
	- Access to Dropbox/Drive - password protected. 
	Definitely don’t want them sitting in the clear in your directory
	- Obscurity - don’t know what files are on his Drive
		- usability for the user
	- Back out of commands 
		- Both need to succeed or neither of them
	- Decrypt to ramdisk
		- Volatile - it disappears. 
		- Don’t really want to save to disk
		- no backup file 

- Remove all client secrets/etc from github repo
