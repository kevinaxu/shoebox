DROPBOX 

- Create Dropbox app so app can access files
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23894221/upload-file-to-my-dropbox-from-python-script

- Install Dropbox python SDK
- Login to the Dropbox account
	- Input the authorization code


Use home-brew to install python

GOOGLE DRIVE 

Google drive quick start:
https://developers.google.com/drive/web/quickstart/quickstart-python

The code is something else that is needed for the flow. Exchange the code for a refresh token and an access token, which are stored in the credentials object. What is used to authorize the upcoming requests to the drive API. 


Stage 2: 
This command line application will be used by a user with their own cloud drives. So they will need to make their own shoebox apps for themselves. 

In order to set up stage 2 for a new user to use, they must first: 
- install the dropbox python SDK
- install the google client library

TODO: Write a write that will automate the process of installing the dropbox python SDK and the google client library. Part of this process will be to. 

ESSAY
“Integrating different cloud platforms is straightforward and follows the pattern of Dropbox and Drive. The cloud client library or SDK needs to be installed and credentials created. Applying the cloud client’s unique client id and client secrets as well as verification is the final step while creating files/folders for shoebox.”

“Downloads and unzips the client libraries…”

DROPBOX
———————
Generate the authorization url with your client id and secret, which will give you an access code. Then, you store the access code and just use that in order to upload. That way you don’t have to do verification every time you want to do a command. 


DRIVE

Only need to implement one version of the following commands: 
- ls, pwd

though implementing all the commands for both would be more complete.
